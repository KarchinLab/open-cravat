3.	AppIcon.icns - for the app image.
4.	Resources/installer_bg.png - for the image in the installer window
5.	Distribution – to insert the image into the installer ( productbuild would make a generic one if no file supplied)

11.	There was an issue with setuptools / pyvcf:
12.	pip install "setuptools<58" --upgrade
13.	pip uninstall pyvcf
14.	pip install pyvcf
Installing oc into the app 
15.	Run make.sh <version>
16.	make.sh uninstalls open-cravat and pip installs new version into the py3 environment
17.	The py3 environment is copied over into the app folder /Contents/Resources
18.	Need to add the folder “launchers” it with oc script in /Contents/Resources
19.	 Run package.sh <version>
Building the installer
20.	package.sh uses pkgbuild to package up the app into the component package called “OpenCRAVAT.pkgbuild.pkg” and attaches the post install script and install location of /Applications/OpenCRAVAT.app.
21.	The Distribution file is edited 
22.	Next it uses productbuild to build the distribution package using the “Distribution” file and image in /Resources to OpenCRAVAT<version>.pkg. This is the final installer.
